AWS Setup and EC2 Instance Configuration
Create IAM User:

Permissions: Create a new IAM user and attach administrative permissions. This allows the user to manage all AWS resources. For a specific purpose like MLflow, you may create a custom policy with permissions limited to S3 and EC2.
Policy: If creating a custom policy, make sure it includes permissions such as:
s3:PutObject
s3:GetObject
s3:ListBucket
ec2:DescribeInstances
ec2:StartInstances
ec2:StopInstances
Access Key: Generate an access key for CLI communication. Save the access key ID and secret access key securely.
Create S3 Bucket:

Command: Go to the S3 section of the AWS Management Console, create a new bucket, and name it (e.g., mlflow-demo). This bucket will be used to store MLflow artifacts.
Launch EC2 Instance:

Operating System: Select an operating system (e.g., Ubuntu for security and ease of use).
Instance Type: Choose t2.micro for free tier eligibility.
Key Pair: Create a key pair for SSH access. Download and save the .pem file securely; itâ€™s used for connecting to the instance.
Network Settings:

Allow Traffic: Configure security group settings to allow SSH (port 22), HTTP (port 80), and HTTPS (port 443) traffic. This ensures you can connect to the instance and access MLflow.
